<h1>"No man is really happy or safe without a hobby"</h1>
<h2>William Osler</h2>
<hr />
<p>My hobbies are an integral part of me, my hobbies are me.</p>
<p>Here is a list of my hobbies that relax me and help me develop:</p>
<ol>
    <h3><li>Crochetting</li></h3>
    <p>This is my favorite! Crocheting helps develop creative thinking and originality. You can create any unique clothes or make your home more comfortable!</p>
    <h3><li>Reading</li></h3>
    <p>Reading introduces you to new ideas; improves your conversational skills; challenges of imagination; reduces stress and many other usefull things.</p>
    <h3><li>Hicking</li></h3>
    <p>I really love nature and physical activity, so I often combine them.</p>
